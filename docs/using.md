# Using the Tracker

I am not going into details.  There's enough online on how to use these things.  The basic summary once everything is assembled, code installed, and electronics wired up:

1. Mount tracker on tripod with tracker closed, off, and gears engaged
2. Do polar alignment (use the visual sight if nothing else to get close)
3. Mount camera
4. Turn on tracker
5. Use camera (focus, test shots, exposures etc)

Note I turn on the tracker BEFORE using the camera.  This minimizes star trails from the beginning and makes staying on target easier.  Also, from what I am reading / hearing from folks at 200mm and a comercial low end tracker you'll get 20s to 30s shots.  Be prepared to try out a lot of things to dial it in!  It's doing its job if you can do a longer exposure with this than untracked.

When done for the night:

1. Turn off tracker
2. Unmount camera and take flats (in whichever order works for you)
4. Setup to take darks
5. While taking darks, take tracker off tripod and cleanup / stow gear

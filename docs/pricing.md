# Pricing

You may be wondering how much all this will cost you.  I'm breaking down the hardware I used including the estimated plastic by weight from Cura based on my print settings.  For example, I used a small torch to heat the rod for bending on a custom built curved form.  I do include the cost of a Raspberry Pi Pico, though I have not built this with a Pico yet.  I will though so it's a valid cost!

I do **not** include:
- tools
- failed prints
- test prints
- electricity for 3D printer
- cost of items bought in packs larger than what was required
- tripod mounting hardware
- tracker power supply
- and other misc used to build the tracker

This cost is only of parts that end up on your tripod for imaging.

**Grand Total:** $56.08

In the cost breakdown here you can see the _camera mount_ is 53% of the cost.  It's worth it.

## 3D Prints

Printed parts I calculate based on $23.00 / 1 kg for filament and the settings noted in [Building: Print Settings](building.md#print-settings).

| What | Filament | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stepper Gear | 3g | $0.07 |
| Threaded Rod Gear | 17g | $0.39 |
| Tracker Top | 168g | $3.86 |
| Tracker Bottom | 147g | $3.38 |
| Raspberry Pi Pico Case | 6g | $0.14 | 
| ULN2003 Case | 18g | $0.41 |

## Electronics and Camera Mount

And finally other parts.  This includes the camera mount, which is by far the most expensive part.  You don't want your camera to slip though, so it's worth finding something reasonably good.

| What | Cost |
| --- | --- |
| 28BYJ-48 + ULN2003 | $2.48
| Raspberry Pi Pico | $5.00 |
| 6 x F/F Jumper Wire | $0.49 |
| [Tripod Head](https://amazon.com/gp/product/B08FB2Q5RC/) | $29.99 |
